# NEAT-Flappy-Bird

NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies(NEAT) is a technique used in machine learning, which mimicks the process of natural selection to evolve a population of AI candidates which can solve a given task.

For this experiment I use NEAT-Python for the NEAT implementation and Pygame for the game logic:

I wrote my own Flappy Bird clone and use the NEAT implementation to train my population.
